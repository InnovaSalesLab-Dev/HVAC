> Use natural number phrasing (e.g., 9,800 = “ninety-eight hundred”).

### Furnace (installation/replacement)

- Positioning note: “Most projects land in the lower to middle of that range.”

## Discount tiers (Client Recognition Programs)
Approximate savings (where applicable):
- **Senior Community Member:** ~10%

- **Educator Thanks:** ~10%
- **First Responder Recognition:** ~10% (police, fire, EMT, paramedics)

### Stacking rules
- Up to **14%** for **2** tiers
- Up to **16% maximum** for **3** tiers

## Weekend / emergency pricing (policy statement)
- Weekend service is **priced case-by-case** depending on the situation
- Emergency service pricing **varies** based on urgency

---

## Out-of-service-area pricing (only after confirming out-of-area)
- Additional travel/extended service fee: **$50 – $110** based on distance
- Use only when it’s confirmed the address is outside the primary area

## Pricing language requirements
✅ Use:
- “less expensive” / “more affordable”
- “lower to middle of that range”
- “most economical solution without cutting back on workmanship quality”
- “accurate quote” / “right number” (not “exact price” early)

❌ Avoid:
- “cheap/cheaper”
- “I’m not allowed to say”
- “I can’t tell you that” (instead: explain assessment requirement)
