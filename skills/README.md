# Skills (portable)

Reusable guidelines for AI-assisted development. Copy this folder to other projects so the same standards apply everywhere.

- **PromptEngineeringSkills.md** — Use when editing system prompts or knowledge bases. Keeps prompts minimal and pushes SOPs/reference into KB. In this project, the Cursor rule **`.cursor/rules/prompt-and-kb-skills.mdc`** applies it automatically when editing `docs/**` or `kb/**`. Copy the `skills/` folder and a `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rule that points to it into each coding project.
