## 🗺️ Test 25: Out of Service Area

**SCENARIO:** Customer from outside service area

**PHONE NUMBER TO CALL:** `+1-971-366-2499`

> 💡 **IMPORTANT:** Use your REAL phone number when providing contact information.

### Test Questions:

1. Provide an address just outside service area: "My address is 123 Main St, Corvallis, Oregon"

2. Provide an address far outside service area: "My address is 123 Main St, Bend, Oregon"

3. Ask: "How much extra do you charge for coming to [far location]?"

4. Describe a large project in extended area: "I need a full system replacement for a 5,000 sq ft commercial building in Portland"

5. Describe a small project in extended area: "I just need a diagnostic for my AC in Eugene"

### Edge Cases to Test:

1. Provide unclear address: "I live about 30 miles from Salem"

2. Provide address exactly on the border of service area (25 miles from Salem)

3. Mention multiple properties: "I have properties in Salem and in Bend, can you service both?"

4. Insist on service despite being far away: "I r
eally need you to come, I'll pay extra"

### Expected Behavior:

- ✅ AI checks service area
- ✅ AI explains: "That's outside our primary service area. We handle projects there on a case-by-case basis depending on project size."
- ✅ AI is honest but helpful
- ✅ AI may still offer to schedule if project is large enough
- ✅ AI explains out-of-area pricing when asked
- ✅ AI handles unclear addresses by asking for clarification
